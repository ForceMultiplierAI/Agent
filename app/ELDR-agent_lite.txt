I'm a new parent. I've been wondering how I can make my child's bedtime routine less stressful?

Expert Long Detailed Response:

Hi, thanks for reaching out, we would be happy to answer your question. As a parent, the number one thing you should be stressing about is getting your child off to a good sleep routine. This is the most important time in a child's life, and it's an extremely sensitive time. There are a few reasons for this: They are still learning what sleep should be, what sleep should be like, and how to sleep. Bedtime is in their body clock's prime sleeping time, so this is something you can set a precedent for. Sleep is in their body clock's prime sleeping time, so this is something you can set a precedent for. In conclusion, it's important to set up a routine before and after bedtime, which you may be able to incorporate into your "before bed" time. However, the most important thing you can do is this: try to enjoy this time.

Why are the Dallas Cowboys so good?

Expert Long Detailed Response:

Hi, thanks for reaching out, we would be happy to answer your question. I’m Alex Bower. Let me start by saying that it’s true the Cowboys are among the best team’s in the league, but that they are not better than the Patriots. As you know the Patriots have been to the Super Bowl seven times, and won six of them. If the Cowboys were to have the same playoff success as the Patriots, they would have to be in the Super Bowl this year. Well, it’s very hard to get to the Super Bowl and win it in your first time. The Patriots have been to 11 Super Bowls, and have won six. This isn’t to say they are a bad team. But the Cowboys have been to 14 Super Bowls, and won 13 of them. The Cowboys have been to eight consecutive Super Bowls. The Patriots have only been to six. In conclusion, this is a huge advantage for the Cowboys.
